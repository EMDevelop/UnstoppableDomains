# UnstoppableDomains

Hi All, 

Back when I thought I was going to become an over-night millionare by snatching up the Google.cryto URL from Unstoppable domains, I wanted a faster way of checking a tonne of potential .cryto domains, their current status and their price. 

This is a Google Script which does just that, I took the Request URL from the Network tab after searching for an address, then programmed the sheet to loop through various words and pull back the info. 

Apologies, but you have to click the Lambo to kick off the script - one day.
